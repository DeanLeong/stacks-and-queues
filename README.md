## Data Structures Cont'd: Stacks & Queues

Peanut butter and jelly, Batman and Robin, Rick and Morty... Stacks and Queues are another iconic duo.

### Objectives

By the end of this lesson and exercise, you should be able to:

1. Define and differentiate stacks versus queues.
2. Understand scenarios in which one is more advantageous than the other.
3. Manipulate stacks and queues for Bracket Matching.

### Introducing Stacks & Queues

What _are_ stacks and queues?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>

- Collections of data which are defined by their behavior of adding or removing data.

#### Stacks

Stacks operate on **LIFO** – last in, first out. The most recently added item will be the first to be removed.

Of course, you've worked with and observed stacks already. Can you name some example?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>

- Internet browser history
- The "undo" action (Command + Z)
- The function call stack

### Queues

Queues operate on **FIFO** – first in, first out. The items are removed from the queue in the order they were added, from first to last.

You also have worked with Queues– can you name some?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>

- Printer job queues
- CPU scheduling

### Efficiency

Of course, with an incredibly limited set of operations, you can get impressive efficiency with stacks and queues:
